# Agentic AI for Corporate Strategy (Reinforcement Learning)

## 📌 **Overview**
This project implements an **Agentic AI for Corporate Strategy** using **Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)**. The AI simulates strategic decision-making for companies, optimizing corporate growth over time in a **marketplace environment**. It evaluates business actions like **investment, marketing, pricing, and acquisitions** using **Q-learning-based reinforcement learning agents**.

## 🏗 **Project Architecture**

### 1️⃣ **Core Components**
The project consists of the following key components:

#### 🏢 **1. Environment (`env.py`)**
- Defines the **marketplace environment**.
- Models company interactions and economic factors.
- Implements **state representation, actions, and rewards**.

#### 🤖 **2. Agents (`agents.py`)**
- Implements **Q-learning agents** that optimize corporate strategies.
- Each agent represents a company and makes strategic decisions.
- Actions include **investment, pricing, marketing, acquisitions, etc.**
- The Q-learning algorithm updates strategy based on **rewards** from the environment.

#### 🎮 **3. Simulation (`simulations.py`)**
- Runs the corporate strategy **reinforcement learning simulation**.
- Trains agents through multiple episodes.
- Logs key metrics like **rewards, capital, and market share** over time.

#### 📊 **4. Dashboard (`dashboard.py`)**
- Implements a **Streamlit-based UI** to visualize simulation results.
- Displays:
  - **Episode-wise rewards & capital** as a DataFrame.
  - **Performance plots (Agent Performance, Capital Growth, Market Share).**
- Uses **Apache Arrow** for optimized DataFrame processing.

## 🔄 **Reinforcement Learning Process**

### 📍 **Workflow**
1. **Initialization** → Define companies, assign starting capital.
2. **Action Selection** → Agents choose actions (investment, pricing, etc.).
3. **Environment Update** → Market conditions adjust based on actions.
4. **Rewards Calculation** → Performance-based rewards assigned.
5. **Training Loop** → Train Q-learning agents over multiple episodes.
6. **Evaluation** → Analyze strategy performance using Streamlit dashboard.
